# TODO: Update README.md with Installation Instructions

- [x] Update the "Install Dependencies" section in README.md to list all installed packages from package.json, grouped by category (Angular, Ionic, Firebase, Capacitor, etc.) for clarity.
- [x] Consolidate installation steps by removing redundant separate install commands for Firebase and GPS plugins, as npm install covers them.
- [x] Ensure the updated section is comprehensive and informative for collaborators.
